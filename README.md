# Ssebowa
Ssebowa is an open source Python library that provides  generative AI models, including:

- ```ssebowa-llm:``` A large language model (LLM) for text generation,
- ```ssebowa-vllm:``` A visual language model (VLLM) for visual understanding,
- ```ssebowa-imagen:``` An image generation and customized fine tuning model,
- ```Ssebowa-vigen:``` A video generation model. 

With Ssebowa, you can easily generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, personalized image generation and answer your questions in an informative way.

For more detailed usage information, please refer to: [Ssebowa's technical documentation](https://ssebowa.ai) 



## Usage

Before running the script, ensure that the required libraries are installed. You can do this by executing the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install .
```
Then install Ssebowa
```bash
pip install ssebowa
```

If you are running this commands in colab or  jupyter notebook please use this,


```bash
!git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
!cd diffusers
!pip install .

!pip install ssebowa
```

Now, you can access the different models by importing them from the library:

# Ssebowa Image generation

Ssebowa-Imagen is an open-source image synthesis model that utilizes a combination of ```diffusion modeling``` and ```generative adversarial networks (GANs)``` to generate high-quality images from ```text descriptions``` and allows also to turn your few photos into ```custom model``` that is capable of generating stunning images of your ```chosen subject```. It leverages a ```100 billion dataset``` of images and text descriptions, enabling it to accurately capture the nuances of real-world imagery and effectively translate text descriptions into compelling visual representations.


## Finetuning on your own data
- Prepare about ```10-20 high-quality``` solo photos ```(jpg or png)``` like yours, friend, product or pets etc and put them in a specific directory.
- Please run on a machine with a GPU of ```16GB or more```. (If you're fine-tuning SDXL, you'll need 24GB of VRAM.)

```bash
from ssebowa.dataset import LocalDataset
from ssebowa.model import SdSsebowaModel
from ssebowa.trainer import LocalTrainer
from ssebowa.utils.image_helpers import display_images
from ssebowa.utils.prompt_helpers import make_prompt
```

```bash
DATA_DIR = "data"  # The directory where you put your prepared photos
OUTPUT_DIR = "models"  
```

```bash
dataset = LocalDataset(DATA_DIR)
dataset = dataset.preprocess_images(detect_face=True)
```

```bash
SUBJECT_NAME = "<YOUR-NAME>"  
CLASS_NAME = "person"
```

```bash
model = SdSsebowaModel(subject_name=SUBJECT_NAME, class_name=CLASS_NAME)
trainer = LocalTrainer(output_dir=OUTPUT_DIR)
predictor = trainer.fit(model, dataset)
# Use the prompt helper to create an awesome AI avatar!
prompt = next(make_prompt(SUBJECT_NAME, CLASS_NAME))
images = predictor.predict(
    prompt, height=768, width=512, num_images_per_prompt=2,
)

display_images(images, fig_size=10)
```
<div align="center">
    <img src=images/ssebowa_im2im.jpg width=90% />
</div>

## Image Generation

```bash
from ssebowa import Ssebowa_imgen
model = Ssebowa_imgen()
```

## Generate an image with the text description 

Like lets generate "A cat sitting on a bookshelf"

```bash
image = model.generate_image("A cat sitting on a bookshelf")
```
## Save the image to a file

```bash
image.save("cat_on_bookshelf.jpg")
```
<div align="center">
    <img src=images/cat.jpg width=90% />
</div>



<div align="center">
    <img src=images/cat1.jpg width=90% />
</div>

# Ssebowa Vision Language Model

Ssebowa-vllm is an open-source visual large language model (VLLM) developed by Ssebowa AI. It is a powerful tool that can be used to understand images. Ssebowa-vllm has 11 billion visual parameters and 7 billion language parameters, supporting image understanding at a resolution of 1120*1120.


```bash
from ssebowa import ssebowa_vllm
model = ssebowa_vllm()

response =  model.understand(image_path, prompt)
print(response)
```

<div align="center">
    <img src=images/vllm.jpg width=90% />
</div>
